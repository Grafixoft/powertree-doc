### Background

Generally speaking, orchestration workloads are complex, multi-step processes which coordinate and execute a series of steps towards automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software.
Orchestrations generally need to be aware of the results of each step and be able to handle failure resiliently.
They can range from being only a few steps to being long-running and involving hundreds and thousands of subsystems.

### How can PowerTree help?

PowerTree's simple programming model allows for easy two-way asynchronous communication between *objects*. It allows developers to focus on implementing valuable logic, instead of wasting time in boilerplate code. All workflows can be easily tested, ensuring their functionality remains intact with changes in business requirements.

PowerTree's code-first approach also allows you to share common logic between workflows, keeping your code DRY. Workflows can be freely composed, proving to be an invaluable tool for managing complexity and code-reuse. 

All of this, coupled with the durability of workflows and the ability to express requirements through code give you the power build testable and resilient orchestrator workflows.
