### Background

Data migration is one of the most common problems modern businesses encounter.
Whether it's to back up your data, or to offload it to a reporting database, building and maintaining an ETL process is hard.
Data commonly has to go through different transformations and validations in order to be written to the target.
While working serially with the data will work initially, it becomes increasingly slow when working with larger volumes of data.

### How can PowerTree help?

PowerTree allows you to offload the bulk of the processing work and execute it in parallel.
This allows you to scale as long as your databases scale and is a good fit for scenarios where either data has to go through multiple processing stages, needs to be collected from multiple sources, or generally speaking, takes a long time to process.
