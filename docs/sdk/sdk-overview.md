The PowerTree SDK gives developers the ability to express complex business processes in a straight-forward fashion through a simple, but powerful interface.
The SDK could be broadly divided into two categories:

* Workflow Interface

    Defines the public types forming the workflow programming model. This is the main entry point for workflow developers and exposes all low-level constructs used to build complex workflows

* Workflow Cmdlets

    A collection of PowerShell cmdlets used to invoke and control workflow execution

The following pages will get you acquainted with the workflow programming model and tooling needed to get started with workflow development.
