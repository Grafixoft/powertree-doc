PowerTree relies on the .NET ecosystem and as such there are a few prerequisites needed to get you started:

* .NET Standard 2.0 compatible .NET installation
* PowerShell
* Optionally, a Microsoft SQL Server 2016+ installation. SQL Server Express LocalDB is the most convenient option for local development.

While both .NET Framework 4.6.1+ and .NET Core 2.0+ are supported we recommend using the latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) with [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows) in order to future-proof your code and maximise cross-platform compatibility.
