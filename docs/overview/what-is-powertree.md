### Serverless Parallel Computing at Large Scale

PowerTree is powerful distributed, parallel computing made easy. Solve large, complex computational problems by breaking them down into smaller problems recursively until a solution tree is formed. Solving all nodes leads to solving the original large problem. Use the simple programing model to let the system solve as many problems as possible in parallel on a cluster of multiple compute nodes.
