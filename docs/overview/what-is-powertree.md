### Serverless Parallel Computing at Large Scale

PowerTree is powerful, distributed, parallel computing made easy. Solve large, complex computational problems by that have proven difficult to solve with traditional software tools. Use the simple programing model to let the system solve as many problems as possible in parallel on a cluster of multiple compute nodes.

It excels at automating long running processes like orchestrations and workflows, or performing intense parallel computations at large scale, among many others. Its developer-friendly, code-first approach with small footprint and flexible architecture allows for rapid adoption in real-world scenarios.
